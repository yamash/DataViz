Our data was extracted from the <a href="https://www.epo.org/index.html"> European Patent Office (EPO)</a>.The EPO offers on its web site several free services, including Espacenet and Open Patent Services (OPS) for searching within more than 90 million patent documents from around the world and from the 19th century right up to today. We used their tool PATSTAT Online to query their database and export structured data.
